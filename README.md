# did-peer-4-ts

This is a did:peer:4 implementation in TypeScript. The main goal of this implementation is to provide a library to back the static resolver found here: https://dbluhm.github.io/did-peer-4-ts/.

I will be the first to admit that I am not a "native" TypeScript or JavaScript developer. What I've done here is likely quirky and may not be suitable for use outside of this context. I used this opportunity to try out [Bun](https://bun.sh), which has been interesting, but I'm not sure that it's left the library in a ready-to-use state.

## Contributing

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.3. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
